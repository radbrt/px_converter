# R PxWebApi converter

This is a small streamlit app that converts json from ssb.no Statbank tables to PxWebApiData function calls - so that we can reduce mindless editing, and don't have to remember how the function call should look. It will work on most PxWeb installations, see [list](https://www.scb.se/en/services/statistical-programs-for-px-files/px-web/pxweb-examples/).
