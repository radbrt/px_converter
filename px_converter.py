# PxWebApiData call creator

Statistics Norway (and Finland and Sweden as well) make the json request for an API call available when you have created a table on the web portal - which is cool.

For people who like using R and the PxWebApiData library, it would be better to get the actual API call - basically a differently formatted version of the JSON.

This app converts the URL and JSON provided by Statistics Norway, or other PxWeb installations, into an `ApiData` function call.
